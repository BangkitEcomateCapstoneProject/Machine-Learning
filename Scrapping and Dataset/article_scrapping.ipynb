Here\\u2019s why you should make the effort to recycle on the go.\\nWhy Recycle On The Go\\nEnvironmental Impact:\\u00a0Picture a street littered with plastic bottles and food wrappers. Not a pleasant sight, right? Beyond aesthetics, this litter poses serious ecological threats. Recycling on the go helps reduce pollution, conserve resources, and protect wildlife habitats, including sea life. Every piece of trash properly disposed of makes a difference.\\nCommunity Health:\\u00a0Littered areas are more than unsightly; they can harm public health. Trash attracts pests and can become breeding grounds for bacteria, contributing to the spread of diseases. Recycling on the go can help keep our communities clean and safe.\\nResource Conservation: Consider the materials we use daily\\u2014paper, plastic, aluminum. Recycling these items conserves natural resources and reduces energy consumption. When we recycle on the go, we ensure that valuable resources are diverted from landfills and reused, benefiting both the environment and future generations.\\nEconomic Benefits:\\u00a0Recycling is good for the planet and the economy. It creates jobs in the recycling industry and can lead to cost savings for municipalities by reducing waste management expenses. Recycling on the go also contributes momentum to sustainable growth in your community\\u2014it sends an essential signal to city leaders that citizens care about a clean environment.\\nAn eco bin in action. The program includes financial support for collection.\\nPersonal Responsibility:\\u00a0We all are obligated to the planet and one another to minimize our environmental footprint. Recycling on the go is a simple yet powerful way to fulfill that responsibility.\\nEducation and Awareness: Recycling on the go isn\\u2019t just about individual actions; it\\u2019s also about raising awareness in our communities. When others see us recycling in public spaces, it prompts them to think about their habits and the impact of their actions. By leading by example, we can inspire others to join the movement towards sustainability.\\nLong-term Sustainability:\\u00a0Ultimately, recycling on the go is about building a more sustainable future. Small changes to our behavior today can create a better world for future generations. Every bottle, can, and piece of paper recycled brings us one step closer to that future.\\nRecycling Challenges in Cities\\nCities face challenges in recycling programs, especially since the \\u201cChina ban\\u201d that made recycling less profitable after emerging economies stopped accepting heavily contaminated materials, like plastic bottles. Many cities only offer curbside recycling, leaving on-the-go recycling overlooked. With recycling bins in public places like parks and streets, people can avoid tossing recyclables in the trash.\\nHowever, while adding sidewalk recycling bins sounds good, someone has to pay for them, and these programs can be too costly for cities. Worse, they can be ineffective. If the bins are not labeled clearly, contamination rates will stay high, reducing the efficiency of local recycling processing.\\nIndependent Solutions for On-the-Go Recycling\\nAt Go Green Eco-Bins, we found a solution that pays for out-of-home recycling. We created a sponsored program, the Clean Streets Initiative, that tackles sidewalk recycling problems without costing cities a dime. Environmentally conscious sponsors support it and collaborate with local recycling groups to ensure proper recycling practices.\\nHow can a program like this be\\u00a0free\\u00a0to\\u00a0cities?\\u00a0Green sponsors make it economically self-sustaining.

The side panels of these Eco-Bins display important messages, including public service announcements, promoting community events, or a straightforward reminder to recycle.\\nAdvertising supports free placement of eco bins in cities.\\nHow Can You Support Sidewalk Recycling\\nAs a citizen, you can make a difference every day. Use sidewalk recycling responsibly. Be mindful of the sidewalk recycling bins, use them for their intended purpose, and encourage others to do the same.\\nRead bin labels carefully:\\u00a0Check what materials are accepted because they vary by city and collection program.\\nAvoid wishcycling:\\u00a0Don\\u2019t throw non-recyclables into the recycling bin, hoping they might be recyclable. When in doubt, throw them out.\\nEducation:\\u00a0Teach children from a young age what recycling is and how it\\u00a0is done\\u00a0correctly.\\u00a0Check Earth911 for guides\\u00a0to recycling hundreds of materials. Engage local schools in your efforts. Work with teachers to incorporate recycling education into the curriculum or organize recycling-themed events.\\nOrganize community meetings:\\u00a0Host informal meetings or gatherings to discuss the importance of recycling and propose implementing sidewalk recycling in your neighborhood. Use these meetings to address concerns and gather support.\\nAdvocate for recycling on social media:\\u00a0Share informative posts, infographics, and success stories to inspire and educate your community. You can create topics and groups about recycling on neighborhood apps like Nextdoor.\\nLobby for change in your city: If on-the-go recycling isn\\u2019t available, advocate for these programs. Together, we can make a positive impact on our environment. Create a petition and collect signatures from community members who support the introduction of sidewalk recycling bins. Present the petition to local authorities or community leaders to demonstrate community interest and need.\\nChange often starts at the grassroots level, but that depends on you. By taking these steps and involving your community in the process, you can contribute to the adoption of sidewalk recycling in a meaningful way.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPost navigation\\n\\n  Planting a Garden for the Birds \\n  Earth911 Inspiration: We Need Wilderness\",\n          \"Featured product: organicgirl good clean greens are delivered in 5 oz., 10 oz., and 16 oz. plastic #1 clamshell containers.\\n\\nRecycling Steps\\nIf your curbside program accepts #1 plastic clamshells:\\n\\nWash the clamshell, removing any organic material.\\nYou can soak labels to remove the paper and leave the remaining adhesive on the package or cut the plastic with labels attached off the clamshell to minimize contamination.\\nDry the container.\\nPlace the clamshell packaging directly in the recycling bin.

Your extra work makes a difference!\\n\\n#1 Plastic Explained\\n#1 Plastic clamshell packaging is common across the United States and is accepted by many local recycling programs in and around major metropolitan areas. Although most recycling programs accept #1 Plastic bottles, some may not accept molded clamshell containers because they are currently incompatible with their recycling systems.\\nSustainability Benefits of Recycling organicgirl Clamshell Packaging\\n\\nRecycling a Plastic #1 clamshells reduces the amount of energy and carbon dioxide emitted during production by at least 30 percent. Organicgirl clamshell containers come with a built-in sustainability boost. Each package is made from recycled plastic bottles.\\nRecycling one pound of organicgirl 5 oz. containers, which is 8.60 clamshells of 1.86 ounces each, reduces the power required to produce another pound of plastic by approximately 3.35 kilowatt-hours, eliminates about one pound of CO2 emissions, and saves almost 2.5 gallons of water used in the manufacturing process.\\nAt that rate, if you ate salad every day and recycled the containers, you would reduce the energy required to make the packaging by 174-kilowatt hours a year. Your carbon footprint would fall by about 52 pounds annually and the water used to make the containers would decline by 130 gallons a year.\\nAdd that up across the country and we\\u2019re talking about a meaningful impact. These small steps add up.\\nData source: Eco-profiles of the European plastics industry\\norganicgirl\\u2019s Ongoing Packaging Efforts\\nOrganicgirl continues to explore better packaging options. It introduced its salad greens in a biodegradable Polyactic acid (PLA) bioplastic container. But the company found that there were not enough industrial composting facilities in the U.S. to reliably process a large share of the PLA. Customers asked for a change, as well, and organicgirl switched to its current recycled PET clamshell package.\\norganicgirl is working with its clamshell packaging provider and Earth911 to identify the gaps in the recyclability of their clamshells. This information will be helpful in directing industry and community programs working to close those gaps. Organicgirl is also investigating new labeling options that could remove the adhesive and paper contamination created by labels.

Advertising supports free placement of eco bins in cities. How Can You Support Sidewalk Recycling As a citizen, you can make a difference every day. Use sidewalk recycling responsibly. Be mindful of the sidewalk recycling bins, use them for their intended purpose, and encourage others to do the same. Read bin labels carefully:\\u00a0Check what materials are accepted because they vary by city and collection program. Avoid wishcycling:\\u00a0Don\\u2019t throw non-recyclables into the recycling bin, hoping they might be recyclable. When in doubt, throw them out. Education:\\u00a0Teach children from a young age what recycling is and how it\\u00a0is done\\u00a0correctly.\\u00a0Check Earth911 for guides\\u00a0to recycling hundreds of materials. Engage local schools in your efforts. Work with teachers to incorporate recycling education into the curriculum or organize recycling-themed events. Organize community meetings:\\u00a0Host informal meetings or gatherings to discuss the importance of recycling and propose implementing sidewalk recycling in your neighborhood. Use these meetings to address concerns and gather support. Advocate for recycling on social media:\\u00a0Share informative posts, infographics, and success stories to inspire and educate your community. You can create topics and groups about recycling on neighborhood apps like Nextdoor. Lobby for change in your city: If on-the-go recycling isn\\u2019t available, advocate for these programs. Together, we can make a positive impact on our environment. Create a petition and collect signatures from community members who support the introduction of sidewalk recycling bins. Present the petition to local authorities or community leaders to demonstrate community interest and need. Change often starts at the grassroots level, but that depends on you. By taking these steps and involving your community in the process, you can contribute to the adoption of sidewalk recycling in a meaningful way.

Recycling Steps If your curbside program accepts #1 plastic clamshells: Wash the clamshell, removing any organic material. You can soak labels to remove the paper and leave the remaining adhesive on the package or cut the plastic with labels attached off the clamshell to minimize contamination. Dry the container. Place the clamshell packaging directly in the recycling bin. Do not bag your plastic recyclables, they will be pulled from the waste stream and sent directly to a landfill. You\\u2019re done, and you made a difference. The recycling center will separate your clamshells from other types of plastic, wash them (again), and shred them before melting them into a resin. The end product is plastic pellets that can be used to make new products. If you drop #1 plastic clamshells at a transfer station: Find a recycling transfer station near you. Wash the clamshell, removing any organic material. You can soak labels to remove the paper and leave the remaining adhesive on the package or cut the plastic with labels attached off the clamshell to minimize contamination. Dry the container. When you arrive at the transfer station, place your clamshells into the appropriate bin. Do not use a plastic bag, place them in the bin separately. You are done! Your extra work makes a difference! #1 Plastic Explained #1 Plastic clamshell packaging is common across the United States and is accepted by many local recycling programs in and around major metropolitan areas. Although most recycling programs accept #1 Plastic bottles, some may not accept molded clamshell containers because they are currently incompatible with their recycling systems. Sustainability Benefits of Recycling organicgirl Clamshell Packaging Recycling a Plastic #1 clamshells reduces the amount of energy and carbon dioxide emitted during production by at least 30 percent. Organicgirl clamshell containers come with a built-in sustainability boost. Each package is made from recycled plastic bottles. Recycling one pound of organicgirl 5 oz. containers, which is 8.60 clamshells of 1.86 ounces each, reduces the power required to produce another pound of plastic by approximately 3.35 kilowatt-hours, eliminates about one pound of CO2 emissions, and saves almost 2.5 gallons of water used in the manufacturing process. At that rate, if you ate salad every day and recycled the containers, you would reduce the energy required to make the packaging by 174-kilowatt hours a year. Your carbon footprint would fall by about 52 pounds annually and the water used to make the containers would decline by 130 gallons a year. Add that up across the country and we\\u2019re talking about a meaningful impact. These small steps add up. Data source: Eco-profiles of the European plastics industry organicgirl\\u2019s Ongoing Packaging Efforts Organicgirl continues to explore better packaging options. It introduced its salad greens in a biodegradable Polyactic acid (PLA) bioplastic container. But the company found that there were not enough industrial composting facilities in the U.S. to reliably process a large share of the PLA. Customers asked for a change, as well, and organicgirl switched to its current recycled PET clamshell package. organicgirl is working with its clamshell packaging provider and Earth911 to identify the gaps in the recyclability of their clamshells. This information will be helpful in directing industry and community programs working to close those gaps. Organicgirl is also investigating new labeling options that could remove the adhesive and paper contamination created by labels. We will update this guide when new labeling is available.
